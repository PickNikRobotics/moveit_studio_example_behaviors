# MoveIt Pro Example Behaviors

This is a sample ROS 2 package for users to create their own custom Behaviors for use in MoveIt Pro.
This repo also includes some other reference Behaviors for users interested in creating more advanced custom Behaviors.

## Usage
This repo should be cloned to the `src/` directory of a colcon workspace to be used with MoveIt Pro.
This repo is also compatible with the the sample [MoveIt Pro Workspace for Universal Robots Arms](https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/moveit_studio_ws) used during the automated install.
See the [MoveIt Pro Documentation](https://docs.picknik.ai) for more information.

For information on using this package to create a custom Behavior, see the [Create a Custom Behavior](https://docs.picknik.ai/en/stable/getting_started/motion_planning_bt_tutorials/create_stateless_behavior/create_behavior.html) tutorial.
