/**
* @brief The SetupMTCWaveHand behavior makes any robot move the end of its arm back and forth.
* @details This is an example of a behavior that uses MoveIt Task Constructor to configure an MTC task,
* which can be planned and executed by MoveIt Studio's core PlanMTCTask and ExecuteMTCTask Behaviors.
* It is derived from AsyncBehaviorBase, an extension of the templated SharedResourcesNode type,
* which augments the core BehaviorTree.Cpp types with an additional constructor parameter 
* to allow the Behavior to access a rclcpp Node owned by the Agent's ObjectiveServerNode. 
* The AsyncBehaviorBase requires a user-implemented function doWork() 
* which is called within an async process in a separate thread.
* It returns an tl::expected which contains a bool indicating task success
* If the task fails, doWork() returns a tl::unexpected which contains a string indicating the error 
* if the process completed successfully or was canceled, 
* or an error message if the process failed unexpectedly.
